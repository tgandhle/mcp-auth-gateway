# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to
follow semantic versioning once a tagged release is cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Audit correlation integrity: the gateway now always generates its own
  request id for the audit record and the upstream `X-Request-Id`. A
  client-supplied `X-Request-Id` is stripped before forwarding and recorded
  separately as `client_request_id`, so a caller cannot choose, collide with,
  or forge the audit correlation id. (`tests/test_app.py`.)
- Threat model (`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`): documents what the gateway defends
  against, what it does not, and the preconditions its security depends on. Each
  defense points at the code or CI that backs it.
- Security policy (`SECURITY.md`): private vulnerability reporting process and
  scope, linked from the README.
- Image publishing (`.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`): builds the
  `Dockerfile` and pushes to GHCR (`ghcr.io/tgandhle/mcp-auth-gateway`) on
  pushes to main (`:main`, `:sha-<short>`) and on `vX.Y.Z` tags (`:X.Y.Z`,
  `:X.Y`, `:latest`). Makes `deploy/k8s/gateway.yaml` runnable against a real
  published image.
- Deployment artifacts (`deploy/`): multi-stage non-root `Dockerfile` built from
  `uv.lock`, and Kubernetes manifests for the gateway, an example upstream, and
  a `NetworkPolicy` that makes the upstream reachable only from gateway pods.
- Trust-boundary CI (`.github/workflows/trust-boundary.yml`): spins up a kind
  cluster with Calico (an enforcing CNI), applies the manifests, and runs a
  bypass-prevention test asserting that a non-gateway pod cannot reach the
  upstream directly. Proves the policy is enforced, not merely valid YAML.
- `deploy/README.md` documenting the trust model, the enforcement caveat (a
  NetworkPolicy is inert under a non-enforcing CNI such as kindnet), and the
  recommendation to add mTLS for high-sensitivity deployments.
- Continuous integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): ruff lint, mypy
  type-check, bandit SAST, pytest, and pip-audit dependency scan, all installed
  from a pinned `uv.lock` for reproducible builds.
- `uv.lock` with hash-pinned dependencies.
- Property-based fuzzing of the JSON-RPC parser (`tests/test_parser_fuzz.py`),
  asserting the fail-closed contract over ~6k generated inputs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the local quality gate.
- Ruff, mypy, and bandit configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed
- `build()` in `__main__.py` now has a precise return type
  (`tuple[FastAPI, Settings]`), removing an incorrect `type: ignore` and making
  the source mypy-clean.
- Package author metadata corrected to `T. Gandhle`.
- Minor lint cleanups in the test suite (unused imports, import grouping).
