# MCP Auth Gateway

An OAuth 2.1 / JWT-enforcing reverse proxy that sits in front of a Model
Context Protocol (MCP) server. It authenticates inbound requests, enforces
per-method scopes, and forwards verified identity to the upstream MCP server.

The MCP transport is JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP. MCP servers themselves usually do
no authorization. This gateway adds that layer without modifying the server:
point your MCP clients at the gateway, point the gateway at the server.

## What it does

- **Token verification.** Validates inbound bearer JWTs against a JWKS
  (RFC 7517) published by your authorization server. Enforces `iss`, `aud`,
  `exp`, `iat` (and `nbf` when present). Pins acceptable signing algorithms to asymmetric only
  (RS/ES/PS); `none` and HMAC algs are refused at construction time, which
  closes the algorithm-confusion class of bypass.
- **Key rotation.** Selects the verification key by the token's `kid`. On a
  `kid` miss it force-refreshes the JWKS once before failing closed.
- **Per-method scope enforcement.** MCP methods (`tools/call`, `tools/list`,
  `resources/read`, ...) are mapped to required scopes by a policy. Read vs.
  invoke is separated by default. Unknown methods are denied by default.
- **Protected-resource metadata.** Serves RFC 9728
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` so spec-compliant MCP clients can
  discover which authorization server guards this resource. 401 responses
  carry a `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing at it.
- **Identity forwarding.** Strips the inbound `Authorization` header before
  proxying and passes verified `sub` / scopes to the upstream via
  `X-Forwarded-Sub` / `X-Forwarded-Scopes`. The upstream trusts these only
  because it sits behind this gateway on a private network.
- **PKCE helper.** RFC 7636 verifier/challenge generation and authorization-URL
  building, for clients that need to acquire tokens.
- **Audit logging.** Every authorization decision emits one structured JSON line
  on the `mcp_gateway.audit` logger: request id, subject, method, decision,
  required scopes, held-scope count, upstream status, latency, source IP. Raw
  tokens and PKCE verifiers are never logged. Scope *values* appear only at
  DEBUG; INFO logs the count.
- **Resilience guards.** Configurable max request body size (default 5 MiB,
  returns `413`) and per-phase upstream timeouts (connect/read/write/pool).

## Why these choices

The gateway verifies tokens; it does not issue them. In an enterprise setup an
IdP (PingFederate, Entra, Auth0, Okta) runs the authorization-code + PKCE flow
and issues the JWT. The gateway's job is the resource-server half of OAuth:
verify the token and enforce scope. That separation is deliberate and matches
how this is deployed in practice.

## Configuration

All config is environment-driven (prefix `GATEWAY_`) or via a `.env` file.

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_URL` | yes | Backend MCP server URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp` |
| `GATEWAY_ISSUER` | yes | Required `iss` claim; also the auth-server id in metadata |
| `GATEWAY_AUDIENCE` | yes | Required `aud` claim; this gateway's resource id |
| `GATEWAY_JWKS_URL` | yes (if auth on) | JWKS endpoint of the authorization server |
| `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_ALGORITHMS` | no | Default `["RS256","ES256"]` |
| `GATEWAY_SCOPE_POLICY_FILE` | no | JSON scope policy; built-in default if unset |
| `GATEWAY_REQUIRE_AUTH` | no | Default `true`; set `false` only for local dev |
| `GATEWAY_HOST` / `GATEWAY_PORT` | no | Default `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | no | External URL (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com`) for metadata/`WWW-Authenticate` when behind TLS or a load balancer |
| `GATEWAY_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` | no | Reject bodies larger than this; default 5 MiB, `0` disables |
| `GATEWAY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` / `_READ_TIMEOUT` / `_WRITE_TIMEOUT` / `_POOL_TIMEOUT` | no | Per-phase upstream timeouts; fall back to `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` |

## Run

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

export GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp
export GATEWAY_ISSUER=https://login.example.com/
export GATEWAY_AUDIENCE=mcp-gateway
export GATEWAY_JWKS_URL=https://login.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json

mcp-gateway
```

## Scope policy file format

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "initialize": [],
    "tools/list": ["mcp:read"],
    "tools/call": ["mcp:invoke"],
    "resources/": ["mcp:read"]
  },
  "default": [],
  "deny_by_default": true
}
```

A key ending in `/` is a prefix rule covering every method beneath it. An exact
method rule overrides a prefix rule. All scopes listed for a rule are required
(AND).

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

Tests sign real RS256 JWTs with a generated RSA key and exercise the verifier,
the scope policy, the PKCE helper, and the full proxy path (including that the
`Authorization` header is not forwarded upstream and that a read-scoped token
cannot invoke a tool).

## Status and limits

- JSON-RPC batch requests (arrays) are rejected with `400 batch_not_supported`,
  because per-item authorization is not implemented and forwarding an
  unchecked batch would let a caller smuggle a method past the scope check.
  Malformed JSON and JSON-RPC objects without a string `method` are likewise
  rejected with `400` rather than proxied. The authorization path fails closed.
- Streaming (SSE) MCP responses are proxied as the upstream returns them; this
  build buffers the response body. Streaming pass-through is a known next step,
  as is an explicit cap on upstream response size (the request side is capped).
- The protected-resource metadata and `WWW-Authenticate` URLs honor
  `GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when set, and fall back to the bind host/port. Set
  it when running behind TLS or a load balancer.
